# Snap to Floor - Unity Editor script

This script allows objects to be automatically snapped to the floor in Unity Editor, eliminating the need to do it manually. It also supports objects with the Skinned Mesh Renderer component, rotated objects, and irregular terrain.

## Usage:
- Add the script to the project.
- Select the object you want to snap.
- Press the 'END' key to snap the object to the floor.（原仓库这里是使用的S建，但是和unity自带的漫游模式冲突了，所以改为了END键。同时也是对齐了ue）
